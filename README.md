# self hanx

Just a simple selfbot.
It is ran on nodejs.

## How to setup:

To setup the selfbot all you need to do is go to settings.json 
and put your token between the parenthesis in the thing called token
and then put your id in the id place. And then click run.bat to run the bot.

Or you could not put the token and just type it into the command line when you run, run.bat but you need the id in the id thingy

(the userid you choose will be the user running the commands.)

## How to login to multiple accounts with the bot:

If you wish to login to multiple accounts with your bot follow these steps:

1. Set all the values on settings.json to nothing
2. Create a json file named anything and copy the settings.json contents and put it into your json file.
3. Then put your token and ID into the json file you made.
4. Open run.bat or run ``node .`` in the console
5. Type in your json files path.

## How to run

Use the run.bat file or in command prompt run ``node .`` or ``node index.js`` in the selfbots directory.
